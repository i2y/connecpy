## Connecpy Examples

## Requirements
You can install requirements for running the examples:
- using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running server
You can run the Connecpy ASGI application using servers such as uvicorn.
Example uvicorn command : `uvicorn --port 3000 server:app`

## Running client
After server has started, you can make request using the example client with the following command :
`python async_client.py` or `python client.py`

Example output :
```
size: 12
color: "black"
name: "bowler"
```

## Generated code
The example server and client makes use of code generated by `protoc-gen-connecpy` plugin. You can find the code in `.` folder. To generate the code yourself for `haberdasher`, use the steps given below:
1. Install `protoc-gen-connecpy` plugin using steps given [here](/README.md)
2. Generate code for `haberdasher` using connecpy plugin :
`protoc --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --connecpy_out=. haberdasher.proto`
  - python_out : The directory where generated Protobuf Python code needs to be saved.
  - pyi_out : The directory where generated Python stub code for Protobuf Messages needs to be saved.
  - connecpy_out : The directory where generated Connecpy Python server and client code needs to be saved.


## gRPC Examples
CoPpy does not support gRPC. However, you can use the same service code to run a gRPC server and client.
`grpc_server.py` uses the same service code as `server.py`.

## Requirements
You can install requirements for running the examples:
- using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Runnning gRPC server
You can run the gRPC server using the following command :
`python grpc_server.py`


### Running gRPC client
After gRPC server has started, you can make request using the example client with the following command :
`python grpc_client.py`

### Generated code
`python -m grpc_tools.protoc --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --grpc_python_out=. -I . .\haberdasher.proto`
  - python_out : The directory where generated Protobuf Python code needs to be saved.
  - pyi_out : The directory where generated Python stub code for Protobuf Messages needs to be saved.
  - grpc_python_out : The directory where generated gRPC Python server and client stub code needs to be saved.
